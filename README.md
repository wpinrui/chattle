Chattle is a chat application whose design is inspired by Telegram. It allows users to chat with an LLM that is hosted by running `server\app.py`.

## Feature roadmap:
- [ ] Chat screen
- [ ] Server endpoint for receiving message
- [ ] Server history management
- [ ] Token system for authenticating app request
- [ ] Sending chat message
- [ ] Receiving LLM reply
- [ ] Conversations list
- [ ] Authentication service
- [ ] Front-end user-differentiated history
- [ ] User history deletion
- [ ] User manual adding of multiple bots (choice of LLM, user-inputted description)
- [ ] Bot groups: different bots reply indefinitely with exponential backoff from user initial prompt time
- [ ] Board game, e.g. chess
- [ ] Card game, e.g. bridge

## Aims
A fun little side project as I begin my full-time software career as a React/Flutter developer. This project allows me to focus on code quality, and apply what I've been learning at work.
